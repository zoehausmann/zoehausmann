Hi, my name is ZoÃ« (she/her/hers). I'm a designer, coder, and interdisciplinary problem solver.
I spend my free time creating art in any medium I can get my hands on, playing video games, and reading manga.
My latest YouTube rabbit holes include storyboarding, music genre mashups, and mechanical computer keyboards.
